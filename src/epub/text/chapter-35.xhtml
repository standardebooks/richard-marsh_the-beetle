			<p>Atherton did not wait to see who might or might not be present, but, without even pausing to take breath, he broke into full cry on the instant⁠—as is occasionally his wont.</p>
			<p>“Champnell!⁠—Thank goodness I’ve found you in!⁠—I want you!⁠—At once!⁠—Don’t stop to talk, but stick your hat on, and put your best foot forward⁠—I’ll tell you all about it in the cab.”</p>
			<p>I endeavoured to call his attention to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham’s presence⁠—but without success.</p>
			<p>“My dear fellow⁠—”</p>
			<p>When I had got as far as that he cut me short.</p>
			<p>“Don’t ‘dear fellow’ me!⁠—None of your jabber! And none of your excuses either! I don’t care if you’ve got an engagement with the Queen, you’ll have to chuck it. Where’s that dashed hat of yours⁠—or are you going without it? Don’t I tell you that every second cut to waste may mean the difference between life and death?⁠—Do you want me to drag you down to the cab by the hair of your head?”</p>
			<p>“I will try not to constrain you to quite so drastic a resource⁠—and I was coming to you at once in any case. I only want to call your attention to the fact that I am not alone.⁠—Here is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham.”</p>
			<p>In his harum-scarum haste <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham had gone unnoticed. Now that his observation was particularly directed to him, Atherton started, turned, and glared at my latest client in a fashion which was scarcely flattering.</p>
			<p>“Oh!⁠—It’s you, is it?⁠—What the deuce are you doing here?”</p>
			<p>Before Lessingham could reply to this most unceremonious query, Atherton, rushing forward, gripped him by the arm.</p>
			<p>“Have you seen her?”</p>
			<p>Lessingham, not unnaturally nonplussed by the other’s curious conduct, stared at him in unmistakable amazement.</p>
			<p>“Have I seen whom?”</p>
			<p>“Marjorie Lindon!”</p>
			<p>“Marjorie Lindon?”</p>
			<p>Lessingham paused. He was evidently asking himself what the inquiry meant.</p>
			<p>“I have not seen Miss Lindon since last night. Why do you ask?”</p>
			<p>“Then Heaven help us!⁠—As I’m a living man I believe he, she, or it has got her!”</p>
			<p>His words were incomprehensible enough to stand in copious need of explanation⁠—as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham plainly thought.</p>
			<p>“What is it that you mean, sir?”</p>
			<p>“What I say⁠—I believe that that Oriental friend of yours has got her in her clutches⁠—if it is a ‘her;’ goodness alone knows what the infernal conjurer’s real sex may be.”</p>
			<p>“Atherton!⁠—Explain yourself!”</p>
			<p>On a sudden Lessingham’s tones rang out like a trumpet call.</p>
			<p>“If damage comes to her I shall be fit to cut my throat⁠—and yours!”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham’s next proceeding surprised me⁠—I imagine it surprised Atherton still more. Springing at Sydney like a tiger, he caught him by the throat.</p>
			<p>“You⁠—you hound! Of what wretched folly have you been guilty? If so much as a hair of her head is injured you shall repay it me ten thousandfold!⁠—You mischief-making, intermeddling, jealous fool!”</p>
			<p>He shook Sydney as if he had been a rat⁠—then flung him from him headlong on to the floor. It reminded me of nothing so much as Othello’s treatment of Iago. Never had I seen a man so transformed by rage. Lessingham seemed to have positively increased in stature. As he stood glowering down at the prostrate Sydney, he might have stood for a materialistic conception of human retribution.</p>
			<p>Sydney, I take it, was rather surprised than hurt. For a moment or two he lay quite still. Then, lifting his head, he looked up his assailant. Then, raising himself to his feet, he shook himself⁠—as if with a view of learning if all his bones were whole. Putting his hands up to his neck, he rubbed it, gently. And he grinned.</p>
			<p>“By God, Lessingham, there’s more in you than I thought. After all, you are a man. There’s some holding power in those wrists of yours⁠—they’ve nearly broken my neck. When this business is finished, I should like to put on the gloves with you, and fight it out. You’re clean wasted upon politics⁠—Damn it, man, give me your hand!”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lessingham did not give him his hand. Atherton took it⁠—and gave it a hearty shake with both of his.</p>
			<p>If the first paroxysm of his passion had passed, Lessingham was still sufficiently stern.</p>
			<p>“Be so good as not to trifle, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Atherton. If what you say is correct, and the wretch to whom you allude really has Miss Lindon at her mercy, then the woman I love⁠—and whom you also pretend to love!⁠—stands in imminent peril not only of a ghastly death, but of what is infinitely worse than death.”</p>
			<p>“The deuce she does!” Atherton wheeled round towards me. “Champnell, haven’t you got that dashed hat of yours yet? Don’t stand there like a tailor’s dummy, keeping me on tenterhooks⁠—move yourself! I’ll tell you all about it in the cab.⁠—And, Lessingham, if you’ll come with us I’ll tell you too.”</p>
